# Fubuki - The Discord Bot
Hi, I am Rorceptus.<br>
Today I'm presenting my first project which is a multipurpose discord bot.<br>
Whether you need entertainment or server managment. This bot can handle all those tasks for you.<br>
This bot comes with a lot of commands related to entertainment or server managment.<br>

I will explain how to get bot token here. For mode detail consider reading the **Instructions.txt** file in Docs folder.

### ➤ How to make a discord bot.

● First you need to visit [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). You need to login with your discord account first.<br>
● Now click on **New Application** and put your application name and then click create.<br>

● Here you can see the **Installation** section. Click on it. Scroll down a bit you will find **Guild Install**, click it and select bot.<br>
● A new option will pop up called **Permission**. Click it and select all the permission you want for your bot. In my case I'm setting it to Administrator.<br>
● Make sure to save changes.<br>
● Now scroll up you will find **Install link** section. Click on copy button and paste it into your new browser tab. And invite the bot into your discord server.<br>

● Now you can see a Bot option on the left side. Click on it.<br>
● Here you can see **Token** section then click on **Reset Token**. Copy the token and keep it safe.<br>
● In case you feel like your token is leaked or someone know it. Then reset it and change it into the code as well.<br>

● On the same page scroll down a bit, you will find **Privileged Gateway Intents** section.<br>
● Enable all three intents as they are required to run your bot properly.<br>

### ➤ Conclusion.
● So we are done here. But you are free to explore as you can set bot descriptions, profile photo etc.<br>
● Refer to the **Intructions.txt** file for to know more about configuration.<br>

● If you are stuck somewhere while following through any steps above mentioned or while configuring the bot consider join my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/gGvayJfFZW).
● I will help you as soon as i can.
